# Fiqh Lesson 1: Understanding the Importance of بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

Alhamdulillah, our first session on Fiqh was inaugurated by our Chairman, Usthad BMM Rasheed Sa'adi Boliyar.

- The Fiqh session began by emphasizing the importance of the book from which the class content is derived, describing the author and the story behind why and how the book was drafted.
- The first point in the class was that if Allah wishes _Khair_ for you, He grants you _Ilm_ (knowledge) of Fiqh.
- Usthad also commemorated the great _Faqeeh_ Thajul Fuqah Bekal Usthad, along with other living _Faqeeh_ among us, including Shaikhuna Jeppu Usthad.
- Usthad mentioned that people in this generation perform many good deeds, but they do not understand the Fiqh behind them; there is abundant _Ibadat_ everywhere, but few understand how _Ibadat_ is actually to be performed.
- After concluding the inauguration, Usthad began the first portion of the Fiqh session, i.e., **Importance of بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم**.

## Key Highlights

- The author of the book beautifully described the significance of _Bismillah_.
- Ali (R.A) said, "If only the letter 'ب' of بسم الله were to be discussed, books worth 70 camels could be written," highlighting the immense importance of just the letter 'ب'.
- The first point is that anything _Khair_ done by people should begin with:

  **بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم**

- If engaging in anything _Haram_ or _Karahath_, do not use _Bismillah_, as unnecessary usage may also lead to _Kufr_.
- If _Bismillah_ is not used for any _Khair_ activity, the _Barakath_ in that activity will be reduced.
- Allah Azzawajall has used _Bismillah_ in every book He has revealed to the world.
- When the Quran was given to us through the Prophet ﷺ by Allah, Jibreel (A.S) said _Bismillah_ three times in the Prophet's ears and mentioned that it was a gift to the Prophet and his _Ummath_. Jibreel (A.S) has been saying _Bismillah_ since Prophet Adam (A.S) without stopping even for a blink of an eye. All Angels of Allah continuously chant _Bismillah_.
- When _Bismillah_ was revealed to this world, all the clouds descended to their extremes, winds ceased swaying, high tides arose in the sea, all animals listened attentively, and Shaitan and his generations suffered greatly.
- Allah has pledged to His servants: using _Bismillah_ on any ill person will bring _Shifa_ within no time.
- Usthad also discussed how a companion of the Prophet was instructed to use only _Bismillah_ to burn Shaitan down to smaller than a housefly instead of cursing him.
- If anyone seeks success in their life, they should use _Bismillah_ often; those who wish to have _Khair_ throughout their life should use _Bismillah_. If one wants to die as a _Shaheed_ (martyr), they should keep saying _Bismillah_ all the time.
- If anyone finds a piece of paper fallen with _Bismillah_ written on it, Allah will send angels to guard it until a _Wali_ (a man of Allah) picks it up and secures it. Allah will raise such a person to high ranks, forgive them, and also forgive their parents.
- If a person continuously says _Bismillah_ for every activity, _Jannath_ will respond to every _Bismillah_ they say and request Allah to save that person from Hell.

Alhamdulillah, these were some of the notable points from yesterday's Fiqh session. The session covered only the **Importance of بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم**, and there is much more to explore, Insha'Allah ❤️.
