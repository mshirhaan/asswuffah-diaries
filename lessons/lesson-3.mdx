# Fiqh Lesson 3: Understanding the Concept of Namaz

Alhamdulillah, our third Fiqh session was conducted by our Chairman, Usthad BMM Rasheed Sa'adi Boliyar. Here are some of the key highlights from this insightful session:

## Recap of the Previous Class

- Usthad began by revisiting some important points from the previous session, emphasizing the importance of following a **Mazhab**.
- We learned about **Imam Shaaf'ii**, the meanings of the terms **Mujthahid**, **Muqallid**, and the concept of **Taqleed**.

## Key Terms Discussed

- **Mujaddid**: A person sent by Allah every 100 years to revive and strengthen the Deen during times of widespread violations and negligence in the community.
- **Mubthadi'i**: A person who does not follow any specific Mazhab (referred to as ನೂತನ ವಾದಿ in Kannada).

## The Role of Prophets and the System of Allah

- Since the beginning, Allah has sent Prophets to guide humanity in both **Deen** (religion) and **Duniya** (worldly matters).
- Allah has established a system to control the universe, such as sending **عزرائيل عليه السلام** (Angel Azrael) to take the souls of living beings.
- While technology has driven the evolution of the world, utilizing modern methods for propagating Islam (like social media) is valid, as long as the principles of Islam are not compromised.
- The ultimate leader of Fiqh and all knowledge is the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who serves as a guide for the entire Ummah.

## Introduction to Namaz

We began our first chapter on Fiqh by discussing the most significant act of worship: **Namaz (Salat)**.

- **Definition**: Namaz is an act of worship that starts with **Takbeerathul Ihram** (raising hands to say Allahu Akbar) and ends with **Salam** (saying peace be upon you), including specific actions and recitations.
- Namaz is also referred to as **صلاة (Swalah)**, which means **Dua** (supplication).

### Importance of Namaz

- Muslims are obligated to perform **5 daily prayers** within 24 hours, as practiced by the Prophet ﷺ.
- As per **Hadiths** from **Sahih Bukhari** and **Sahih Muslim**, the Prophet ﷺ instructed Mu'adh (R.A) to teach the people of Yemen the obligation of 5 daily prayers.
- There are a total of **17 Rak'ahs** in the 5 daily prayers (2 for Fajr, 4 for Dhuhr, 4 for Asr, 3 for Maghrib, and 4 for Isha), symbolizing the 17 hours dedicated to prayer, while the remaining 7 hours are for rest.

## Historical Background of the Five Daily Prayers

- The honor of the 5 daily prayers was specifically given to the Ummah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.
- Different Prophets were assigned different prayers:
  - **Fajr**: Prophet Adam (A.S)
  - **Dhuhr**: Prophet Dawood (A.S)
  - **Asr**: Prophet Sulaiman (A.S)
  - **Maghrib**: Prophet Ya'qub (A.S)
  - **Isha**: Prophet Yunus (A.S)
- The 5 daily prayers were gifted to us by Allah during the **Isra' and Mi'raj** (Night Journey), which took place on the 27th of Rajab.
- Initially, 50 prayers were obligated, but by the mercy of Allah, they were reduced to 5.

## The Obligation of Namaz

- **Namaz** is mandatory for every Muslim who has reached puberty and is in a sound state of mind, with the following exceptions:
  - Those who have lost their mental capacity due to illness or intoxication.
  - Women during menstruation (حيل) or postnatal bleeding (نفاس).
  - Non-Muslims by birth are exempt, but **Murtads** (apostates) are still obligated to pray.
  - Children are not obligated, but it is the responsibility of parents to teach them.

### Significance of Ablution (Wudu)

- Ablution is the prerequisite for Namaz. On the Day of Judgment, believers will be recognized by the brightness of their body parts that were washed during Wudu.
- The act of Wudu has the power to cleanse sins from the body, wherever the water touches.

### First Namaz Observed by the Prophet ﷺ

- The first Namaz prayed by the Prophet ﷺ was **Dhuhr**, on the 27th of Rajab, during the event of Mi'raj.
- Fajr prayer was not observed that day as **Jibreel (A.S)** had not yet conveyed the procedure.

## Concluding Notes

- The Prophet ﷺ prayed for 13 years and instructed his companions to continue observing Namaz as they had seen him pray.
- For those who did not witness the Prophet ﷺ praying directly, the knowledge has been passed down through generations of scholars and teachers.
- Proper knowledge of Namaz should be learned through this chain of succession, not merely from direct translations.

Alhamdulillah, these were the key takeaways from our third Fiqh session. There's much more to learn as we continue our journey into the depths of Islamic jurisprudence, Insha'Allah ❤️.
