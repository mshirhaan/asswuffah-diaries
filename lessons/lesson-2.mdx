# Fiqh Lesson 2: Understanding Bismillah and Alhamdulillah

## Introduction

Alhamdulillah, our second session on Fiqh was conducted by our Chairman, Usthad BMM Rasheed Sa'adi Boliyar. Here are the key highlights from the session.

## Recap and Importance of Bismillah

- The session began with a recap of points from the previous class regarding the importance of بسم الله
- بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم consists of 19 letters, and 19 Angels will ask Allah for your protection from Hellfire
- The Prophet ﷺ prayed to Allah to provide him with abundant knowledge, saying "Oh Allah, do not provide me knowledge which is of no value," as such knowledge is pointless without benefit or scope for improvement

## The Significance of Alhamdulillah (الحمد لله)

- The Holy Quran begins with the two most important words: بسم الله and الحمد لله
- Not saying الحمد لله indicates insufficient gratitude to Allah
- Like بسم الله, we should consistently use الحمد لله in our daily routines
- We should be among those who say الحمد لله continuously and be grateful for being among such people
- Categories of grateful people:
  - Shakoor: Those who say الحمد لله all the time
  - Shakir: Those who say الحمد لله only on special occasions
- Allah has noted that this generation has fewer Shakir's than Shakoor's

## Usage and Importance in Islamic Practices

- الحمد لله is essential in:
  - Surah Al-Fatiha
  - Beginning of Friday Khutuba (obligatory)
  - Beginning of Nikah Khutuba (Sunnah)
  - Daily activities like eating and drinking

## Special Supplications

- The dress-wearing supplication includes الحمد لله:
  "اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّهِ الَّذِي كَسَانِي هَذَا الثَّوْبَ وَرَزَقَنِيهِ مِنْ غَـيـْرِ حَوْلٍ مِنِّي وَلَا قُـوَّةٍ"

  - Reward: All sins are forgiven when recited while dressing

- The elevated dua: حَمْدًا يُوَافِي نِعَمَهُ وَيُكَافِئُ مَزِيدَهُ
  - Background: Taught to Prophet Adam (A.S) when he requested Allah for a comprehensive dua
  - Virtue: Reciting three times during Morning and Asr fulfills one's share of gratitude to Allah

## Additional Virtues

- الحمد لله contains 8 letters, corresponding to 8 doors of Heaven opening for those who say it continuously
- Reciting Al-Fattah 71 times after Subah Namaz with hand on chest brings:
  - Brightness and purity to the heart
  - Ease in difficulties

## The Importance of Swalath

- No act is complete without invoking the Prophet ﷺ
- The entire universe's creation finds its purpose through the Prophet ﷺ
- Swalath Majlis has a special fragrance perceivable to all creation except humans and Jinn

## Understanding Fiqh and Madhab

- Taqwa is essential for learning Fiqh
- Our session follows Imam Shafi'i's (R.A) principles
- Explanation of Madhab:
